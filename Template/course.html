Web Developers, Project Managers, Software Architects and Testing Professionals are the key beneficiaries of this course.</div></p>
									<h4>Why Learn AngularJS?</h4>
								<p><div><div style="text-align: justify;">AngularJS, a MVW framework from Google is based on JavaScript, a language globally known to millions of developers worldwide - thus giving it a much lower learning curve even for first-time developers. Integrating AngularJS is quite simple as it evaluates the page once HTML is in the DOM and make easier to bind Angular on top of existing applications. It can run along with Node.js, an asynchronous development platform with lightning speed execution, which makes building Mean Stack applications easier and faster. AngularJS comes with a very good documentation and also has a wide range of third party modules making it user-friendly for developers.</div></div></p>

												<h4>Why Learn Comprehensive Java Course?</h4>
											<p><p align="justify">Java is a general-purpose, class-based,
								  object-oriented computer programming language that was designed by
								  James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.</p>
								<p></p>
								<b>Key Highlights of Java:</b>
								<p></p>
												<p align="justify">
								  <strong>Platform Independent:</strong> This allows programmers to
								  develop applications that can run on any operating system.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p align="justify">
								  <strong>Usability of Java:</strong>  Java is most widely used
								  programming language. It is present everywhere. It really doesn't
								  matter in whichever domain you work in, you will surely come across
								  Java sooner or later!</p>
								<p></p>
								<p align="justify">
								  <strong>Open Source:</strong> The good news is that Java is available
								  for free! All the development tools and the environment (JRE &amp;
								  JDK) that is used to develop Java applications are absolutely free of cost.</p>
								<p></p>
								<p align="justify">
								  <strong>Android:</strong> Irrespective of the fact whether you are
								  tech savvy or not, most of us are badly bitten by the Android bug!
								  Android is in great demand today and fortunately you need Java for
								  Android. Hence the importance of Java has increased even more.</p>
								<p></p>
								 <p align="justify">In spite of having a tough competition on the server
								  side from Microsoft and other companies, Java is doing extremely well
								  on mobile platforms, thanks to Android!</p>
								<p></p>
								  About this Course:
								<p></p>
								<p align="justify">This self-paced course starts from elementary
								  concepts assuming that you don't have any prior knowledge about
								  Java and is designed to cover advanced topics like Collections,
								  Threading, Databases and more.</p>
								 <p></p>
								<b>Course Highlights:</b>
								<p></p>
								1. The course is based on GKTCS's Project Based Learning Approach.<p></p>
								2. Recorded sessions of all the classes will be provided to you.<p></p>
								<p align="justify">3.There will be Module-wise quizzes and coding
								  assignments to re-enforce your understanding.</p>
								4.After completion of Course, a Java Skill Certificate will be provided
								to each student.<p></p></p>
