           	<br/>
           	<br/>
           	
           	<b>Question:  Explain how (almost) everything is an object in Ruby?</b><br/>
Ans. This is a simple question based on complex concept. Here’s your chance to show off your theoretical knowledge and demonstrate that you can have an in depth conversation on class hierarchies, inheritance, methods, encapsulation, polymorphism, and more.
<Br><BR>
Explaining this could take an hour or a few minutes – there’s no single correct answer here, save from being able to demonstrate your familiarity with OOP concepts.
<br><Br>           
            <b>Question: What’s your favorite testing tool?</b><br/>
Ans: The specific answer here is probably not important in and of itself – What’s important is that you can demonstrate familiarity with at least several testing tools, and be able to discuss their individual advantages and weaknesses. Never ventured outside of Rails default testing tools? Take some time to familiarize yourself with tools such as Rspec, FactoryGirl, Capybara, and Cucumber.
<br><br>

<b>Question: What are Gems and which are some of your favorites?</b><br/>
Ans.  Gems are packaged bits of Ruby code that you can install to extend or add functionality to your app.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Question: What does ruby name refers to??</b><br/>
Ans. Ruby names refer to the classes, variables, methods, constants and modules that help in the creation of the program. 

<b>Question: What is the difference between Symbol and String?</b><br>
Ans. The symbol in Ruby on rails act the same way as the string but the difference is in their behaviors that are opposite to each other.
<br/>
<bR>
<b>Question:What does Session and Cookies represent in Ruby on Rails?</b><br/>
Ans.
<li>Sessions are important as they provide with useful information regarding the customer and different server side information. </li><br>

<li>Cookies on the other hand use the store information that are stored on the client side platform or related to the browser. </li><br>

<li>Sessions are required to store the information regarding the user’s information and the actions that he will take only. </li><br>

<li>The session is given as: session [:user] = “Rohit”.</li><br>

<li>The session remains till the browser till the information is getting stored and the browser is getting closed by the user for the same.</li><br>

<b>Question: What is the role of MVC architecture in Ruby on Rails?
</b><br/>
Ans. <li>MVC (Model-View-Controller) is the architecture that provides flexibility and scalability of the applications. </li><br>

<li>It is almost having the same concept in any other language like PHP, Perl or Python. It is one of the major used architecture involved today due to its simplicity.</li><br> 

<li>Controller is the main part in this kind of architecture where it handles the request that is coming from another controller. </li><br>

<li>Controller contacts the view and passes on the request to the view and it also interacts with the model to define the type of request. </li><br>

<li>Model is responsible for interacting with the database and provides the responses to the controller.</li><br> 

<li>Controller takes the response and gives the response in the output form to the user that has made the request.</li><br>
<br><Br>

<b>Question:  What is the function of ORM in Ruby on Rails?</b><br/>
Ans. <li>ORM stands for Object Relationship Model that models the classes and helps in setting a relationship between the existing models.</li><br> 

<li>It allows the classes to be mapped to the table that is present in the database and objects get mapped to the rows in database table. </li><br>

<li>It shows the relationship that exists between the object and frame it using the model to display the output to the users. </li><br>

<li>It keeps the data in the database according to its relationships and performs the functions accordingly. </li><br>

<li>It maps the database in case of any updates and update for the same if the fields are changed or new values are entered.</li><br>

           	<br/>
    
          <b>Which text editor should I use with Ruby on Rails?
</b><br/>
Any text editor that supports Ruby syntax highlighting will do. This is available in most text editors aside from ones like Notepad. If you've already got a favorite text editor then chances are that it supports Ruby on Rails.
<br><BR>
If you're looking for something new or different, here is a list of the most popular Rails editors:
<br><BR>
<li>Textmate - This free editor is popular with Mac users.</li><br>
<li>Sublime Text - Similar to Textmate, this editor is available for Windows, Mac and Linux</li><br>
<li>Atom - Similar to Sublime and produced by some Github folk, this editor is available for Windows, Mac and Linux</li><br>
<li>Vim - When used along with rails.vim this is a powerful editor. However the learning curve is much steeper than most editors.</li><br>
<li>Emacs - A popular vim alternative, Emacs has comprehensive Rails support</li><br>
<li>E Text Editor - Another Textmate like editor, this one is popular amongst Windows users</li>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Which IDE should I use with Ruby on Rails?
</b><br/>
The answer depends on what sort of programming environment that you are used to using. If you are just learning a Rails then it's best that you don't burden yourself with learning a new IDE too. If you've already been using an IDE for another programming language, then I suggest sticking with the Rails equivalent, at least until you're familiar with Rails and its rake commands.
<br><br>
Some popular IDEs that have Rails support are:
<br><br>
<li>Eclipse (via RadRails) - This is the most popular free IDE</li><br>
<li>JetBrains (via RubyMine) - This is the most popular paid IDE</li><br>
<li>Netbeans - Netbeans discontinued official support as of version 7.0, but there is a community supported plugin</li><br>
<li>Visual Studio (via Ruby in Steel) - Is somewhat expensive but will please Visual Studio fans. Has a free 60-day trial</li><br>
<li>Komodo IDE - Has auto-complete and debugging features for Ruby on Rails</li>
<br><Br>

<b>What are some good free resources for learning Ruby?
</b><br/>
There too many to list here, so here are a few of the best known ones:
<br><Br>
<li>Humble Little Ruby Book provides a great overview of the language, from installation to the standard library. Available for free in PDF and HTML form, or can be bought as a paperback.</li><br>
<li>Ruby Koans are a set of programs design to teach Ruby with a test driven philosophy.</li><br>
<li>Hackety Hack is a program designed to teach the basics of programming. It's best suited for those with no to little to no previous programming experience.</li><br>
<li>Programming Ruby (The Pickaxe book) is the first and best know Ruby book. The first edition is free online, but many consider it to be dated.</li><br>
_Why’s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby is probably one of the only programming books with comic strip intermissions. It's unique style doesn't appeal to everyone, but most will agree it's a lot of fun.</li>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Why should I learn Ruby on Rails?
</b><br/>
There are plenty of good reasons to learn Ruby on Rails.
<br><Br>
<li>You want to build web applications. This what Rails was built for. Rails includes everything needed to build a web application</li><br>
<li>Many software developers who use Ruby on Rails say that they can build and release software in a shorter amount of time when using Rails as compared to other platforms.</li><br>
<li>A large community of developers build and release plugins, libraries, documentation and tutorials for Rails, resulting in a rich set of resources to help build your application (all for free!)</li><br>
<li>Rails is a community run project and is not controlled by any one person or company. It's not a loss leader used to shoehorn you into buying some sort of software or service, it's goal is strictly to be the best platform for building web applications.</li><br>
<li>Many software developers enjoy using Ruby and Rails. You might enjoy it to.</li><br>
<br><BR>
<b>What does the triple equals operator do in ruby?
</b><br/>
The triple equal operator is generally used to determine if an object belongs to a set. For example, an instance of a class belongs to the class, a number in a range belongs to that range, etc.
<br><Br>
<b> Should I learn Ruby before learning Rails?
</b><br/>
While it's certainly possible to begin learning Rails without any prior Ruby exposure (especially if you have prior experience with other dynamic languages + frameworks, ex: Python + Django), it's recommended that you spend some time working with Ruby first as it will make life easier for yourself.
<br><Br>

<b>What is a good blog engine that I can incorporate into my Ruby on Rails application?
</b><br/>
The first question you need to ask is if you really need it to be Rails based. Given that you are looking for an engine rather than building the functionality you need usually indicates that you'd be better off using mature blogging software like Wordpress (or similar).
<br><Br>
If you decide that you really do want to incorporate a blog engine, then check out The Ruby Toolbox's Blog Engines guide. It gives a good overview on what's available.
